# Summary
This workshop introduces researchers and computational scientists to the use of Apptainer, a powerful containerization tool tailored for non-root environments such as HPC systems. Participants will learn how to create, configure, and manage reproducible pipelines, enabling efficient and portable scientific workflows. By the end of this workshop, attendees will be able to leverage Apptainer to simplify software dependencies and improve collaboration on HPC clusters.
